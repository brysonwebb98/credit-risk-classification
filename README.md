An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to look at borrowers and various things about them such as all of the X values also known as features. We took at look at their debt to income, number of accounts, how many times they have been derogatory, total debt and much more. From there we took some training data and test date to create a model that tells us if it is going to be a healthy loan or a high risk loan. 

Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

Accuracy Score: The accuracy score shows at about 99%. That is good but in a real world setting we have learned in class that if your model is that good that fast you need to take another look at it because that does seem high. Overall you do want a high accuracy score. 

Precision Score: The precision teslls us how many of the items predicted were actually what we thought. We ended with 100% on class 0 and 85% on class 1 which I feel is pretty good there is some room for improvement on group 1. 

Recall Score: For class 0 99% of them were correctly identified by the model and class 1 there was about a 91% identification done. 

A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

In a real world setting I think that if you could get your model to be this good I would recommend it to a bank or financial institution. I do believe that it has a good accuracy. I do believe there are many thing that have outliers such as if someone loses their job or with COVID. It would be interesting to get that type of data to take a look then and see how long they have been at their job and education because I think those things will help with a good loan in comparrison to a high risk loan.
